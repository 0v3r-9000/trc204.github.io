# 🧠 Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my machine learning portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects I’ve built to practice and demonstrate my skills across various ML domains — including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and deployment.

Each project is self-contained in its own folder with code, documentation, and results.
